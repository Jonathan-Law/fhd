# Quick starter

## Getting Started
1. clone this repo
2. install dependencies `$ npm install`
3. create new (empty) repo on github and copy it's SSH link
4. run setup command `$ npm run setup` and follow prompts
5. upload to remote location `$ npm run upload`

### What does the setup task do?
1. Configures `package.json` { name, version, decription, repository } props.
2. renames git remote to this repo from 'origin' to generator.
3. creates new 'origin' remote to newly created repo
4. adds and commit's all new files
5. pushes changes to remote.

## Usage
- `$ npm setup` to setup your repo to new git remote
- `$ npm start` to run webpack-dev-server
- `$ npm test` to run unit tests
- `$ npm tdd` to continuously run tests
- `$ npm run eslint` to lint code
- `$ npm run build` to build (and minify)
- `$ npm version (patch|minor|major)` to create git release

## Adding or removing platform views (mobile, desktop)
- Change config values at top of `webpack.config.js`

```js
// set views to true if you want to include them in you app
// these can be changed at any time.
var INCLUDE_DESKTOP_VIEW = true;
var INCLUDE_MOBILE_VIEW = true;
```

## Updates
To update your build tools, we can use git to handle most of the hard work for us.

```bash
$ git pull generator master
```

You may have to resolve some merge conflicts but for the most part, this should be pretty painless.

### Updating CDN'd dependencies
If you would like to add/edit/remove a dependency from a CDN, you'll need to add/edit/remove the script tag in your main HTML file, you'll also have to add/edit/remove it to the `webpack.config.js`'s `externals` property and to the `karma.conf.js`'s array variable called CDNS.
