      In the near future we plan to include the ability to <strong>collect your favorites</strong> by watchlisting them for better visibility from your family page and periodic update emails. We will also be adding a <strong>feedback feature</strong> that will allow you to send your thoughts, opinions, and suggestions straight to the site administration for review.

    <p style="padding:0px 50px;">Dear reader, this is a family collection of stories and photos from many sources. We are always collecting photos and permissions to post new things here if you want to add to this collection. We do need to warn you that while we try very hard not to make mistakes in this collection, it is possible that you will find an error. Use this website at your own risk. We make no guarantees, but if you contact us with evidence, we will fix it here on the website because we want it to be right. Each person has basic information, a photo collection, a document collection, and a photo pedigree chart. Please enjoy learning more about our family! â€” Michele Law
